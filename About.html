      <p class="text"> The Manaia is a mythical creature from the Maori Culture. 
        This creature is represented by the head of a bird, 
        the body of a snake and the tail of a whale and 
        symbolises the balance between sky, earth and sea. 
        The Manaia has inspired and influenced me in many 
        aspects of my life and in my designs. Thus, Manaia 
        Design was born and became my philosophy.<br /><br />
        My name is Terry, I am a Mauritian born Graphic Designer.
         I studied and lived in Australia for three years 
        where I also graduated with a Diploma in Graphic 
        Arts. I have acquired  work experience in New Zealand,
         Australia, Mauritius and Germany. I am currently based
        in Hamburg, Germany so feel free to hit me up if you have
        ideas, suggestions or a project you would like to collaborate on.</p>
